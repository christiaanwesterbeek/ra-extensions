# react-admin extensions

Let's start of by saying that react-admin rocks! That means the people building and supporting it are really all-in with this framework. I'm using it personally for all my clients. Sometimes it happens that a feature or component is requested, but it isn't getting added to react-admin. In those cases it's often said that they won't add it add it and it can be solved in userland. I respect that. Nonetheless the issue remains unresolved in some of those cases. This repo is here to provide an additional set of components, hooks, action, etc that are not added (yet) to react-admin itself.
